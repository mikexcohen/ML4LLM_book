# 50 ML projects to understand LLMs

Code repository for the book "50 ML projects to understand LLMs: Investigate transformer mechanisms through data analysis, visualization, and experimentation" by Mike X Cohen, PhD.

## About This Repository

This repository contains all Python code and Jupyter notebooks for the 50 projects in the book. Each project includes:

- **Helper notebook**: Incomplete code with guidance to work through the project yourself
- **Solutions notebook**: Complete, working implementation with detailed explanations

All code runs on Google Colab, so you don't need to install anything locally or manage library configurations.

## About the Book

Learn how LLMs like GPT and BERT actually work by applying machine learning techniques to their internal activations. This book takes a unique approach: rather than building LLMs from scratch or using them via APIs, you'll investigate their mechanisms by treating hidden states, attention patterns, and embeddings as data to analyze.

Through 50 hands-on projects, you'll learn to:

- Inspect and visualize transformer internals
- Analyze attention mechanisms and layer dynamics
- Apply statistical and causal methods to understand model behavior
- Manipulate activations to test hypotheses about LLM mechanisms

Each project teaches skills in three areas: machine learning techniques, LLM mechanisms, and Python coding with data visualization.
